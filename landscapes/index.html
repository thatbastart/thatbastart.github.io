                <span class='subHeadline'>Illegal market</span><br><br>
                <span class='text'>Due to the high demand, a lively market for the export of mahogany wood arose in some countries in the whale of mahogany. The increased value of the market resulted in more and more regulation.<br><br>In the case of Brazil, the regulations went so far that the mahogany market went from being a legal prosperous market to an illegal market marked by violence in just a few years.<br><br>This story tries to briefly present the increasing violence due to illegalization of the mahogany market in Brazil and the causal effects on the people being involved either by living in the corresponding areas or by actually participating in the market activities.</span><br><br><br>
                <span class='subHeadline'>Brazilian market transformation</span><br><br>
                <span class='text'>Brazil has historically been the main world producer of big leaf mahogany, with more than 70% coming from the state of Pará.<br><br>From the end of the 1990s to the early 2000s, the Brazilian government implemented a series of policies progressively restricting the extraction and trade of mahogany, culminating with prohibition in late 2001.<br><br>The two main restrictions were those introduced in March 1999 – when 85% of the management licenses were suspended – and October 2001 – when mahogany extraction was finally prohibited.</span><br><br><br>
                <span class='subHeadline'>Smuggling</span><br><br>
                <span class='text'>Despite tightened regulations, mounting evidence points to the continuing smuggling of big leaf mahogany was formally exported under the guise of “other tropical timber species”.<br><br>Brazilian exports under the trade category “other tropical timber species” jumped by 1.800 % in a single month in 1999 and were sustained at volumes comparable to those of former exports of big leaf mahogany.<br><br>The existing evidence suggests that regulations that significantly reduced exports of big leaf mahogany and finally culminated into outright prohibition created an active illegal market.This highlights the relevance of this potential market to the local economy.</span><br><br><br>

                <span class='subHeadline'>Violence</span><br><br>
                <span class='text'>There a lot of existing reports that discuss illegal logging as intrinsically related to the widespread use of violence.<br><br>In the Brazilian Amazon, protected timber species are stolen from private land, indigenous and conservation areas and public land. Intimidation driven deals with indigenous tribe leaders are also commonly reported.<br><br>Whereas illegal extraction of mahogany already occurred before prohibition, there was an increase in organized crime in Pará after 2001 documented.<br><br>In the process of extracting mahogany, loggers are said to resort to illegally obtained weapons and threat execution of whoever may offer any resistance. Threats and murders of rural workers, non-governmental organization leaders, and government officials attempting to disrupt the functioning of the illegal mahogany market have been widely publicized.</span><br><br>
                <span class='subHeadline'>Mahogany mafia</span><br><br>
                <span class='text'>Reports from the media suggest a significant depth of the so-called “mahogany mafia”. While describing individuals involved in this trade, a federal police officer states that “we are not dealing with small transgressors, but a mafia (…). They use violence, move large fortunes and coerce the small guys.” Allegations of this nature led to a formal arraignment by a prosecutor in the state of Pará.<br><br>According to its report, the “mahogany mafia” – who illegally extracted the timber to be sold in international markets – built clandestine roads, bridges, andairstrips, assembled a “war arsenal,” and exploited slave labor.<br><br>Influential politicians, indigenous tribe leaders, and public officials from federal and local governments have also been accused of involvement in the illegal mahogany market.</span><br><br>
