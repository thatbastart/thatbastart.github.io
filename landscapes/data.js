        content:"Relational Landscapes was a class with design students at FH Potsdam, that aimed to discuss and make visible the hidden and unhidden connections between South America and the Brandenburg region in Germany.<br><br>The 19th-century scientific explorations of South America (such as the Prussian Langsdorff expedition to Brazil and the Alexander von Humboldt expeditions) set the scenery in which a myriad of things began to travel between South American and Central European landscapes. If at the beginning of this entangled history things traveled in the form of collections, today, in a globally interconnected world, these movements between distant lands and populations assume the form of big markets of commodities such as corn, soya, wood, meat, and rare earth and minerals, such as lithium.<br><br>The advent of these markets produced the counter-effect of changing local climatic/atmospheric conditions and ecologies on both sides of our distant but intertwined worlds. Mining and intensive agriculture destroy territories in South America. At the same time, they feed factories and industries in Brandenburg which also risk environmental harm, such as the Tesla Giga factory or the multiple intensive cattle breeding units found in Germany.<br><br>Our introductory sessions explored the numerous examples of ecological, social, economic, and cultural relationships between South America and Central Europe, highlighting the erasure of indigenous epistemologies and knowledge practices that characterize these processes and the many hidden technologies developed to transport resources between these regions. These examples were further discussed in an international symposium in which we debated indigenous epistemologies, seed journeys, tree watching, media aesthetics, and the pluriverse!<br><br>On a visit to the greenhouses of the Botanical Garden of Berlin, we could approach these topics in a concrete way: plants transported from distant lands, technologies developed to keep them, and scientific structures that translate indigenous knowledge to other cultural realities.<br><br>This complex set of examples and experiences inspired the students’ projects developed in the second stage of the course. After exploring a chain of connections between South America and Brandenburg, they traced multi-layered interrelations through space and time and developed experimental and interactive visualizations for a broader public.<br><br>The outcome of this learning process is the website you are now visiting and experiencing. The visual narratives were collated in a point cloud that invites you to explore relational landscapes, knowledge, and traditions playfully.",

        authors:"Hannah Machajdik & Victor Molina",
        content:"Ayahuasca is a pan-Amazonian psychoactive brew made out of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine (yagé), the Psychotria viridis shrub (chacruna), and possibly other ingredients. It is used both socially and as ceremonial spiritual medicine among some indigenous peoples of the Amazon. When consumed, it can cause an altered state of consciousness, including visual hallucinations and altered perceptions of reality. Ayahuasca ceremonies are becoming increasingly popular in Europe and the United States, and for several years tourism to South America for the purpose of ingesting ayahuasca has increased greatly. Ayahuasca retreats are now being established around the world, allowing anyone to participate in the experience, whether in a traditional or non-traditional way.<br><br>In this project we wanted to look further into the interconnectedness between Europe and South America, focussing on the boundary object, practice or concept of ayahuasca, contemplating how the cultural, social, geographical and economic landscapes around it have changed throughout the years.<br><br>The result is an augmented reality liana, that can grow anywhere in the world, by just scanning a QR-code with your phone. Once it's placed, you can walk around it and find a lot of information, articles about and experiences of ayahuasca in South America but also Europe, collected on little tokens that are placed in different parts of the plant. Additionally there is an interview with a shaman of the Amazonian tribe Shuar in Ecuador who guides traditional ayahuasca experiences in his community, talking about his view on the concept of spirituality, spiritual tourism, the economic profit from it and his own path of learning about ayahuasca.<br><br>We invite you to scan the QR-code and explore the liana yourself!<br><br><img src='hv/qrcode.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'>",

        authors:"Sabrina Machado",
        content:"This project was initiated by investigating correlations between the forests in Brandenburg, Germany and the Amazon rainforest, Brazil.<br><br>According to the Forest Condition Report 2021, 73% of all trees in Brandenburg are pines, of which only 10% have no crown damage. The history of pine cultivation in Brandenburg is marked by the species' good adaptation to the region's sandy soil associated with the need for wood production. However, since monocultures are more susceptible to pests and forest fires, what seemed like a good solution ended up creating a new challenge for the region.<br><br>After a period of research, the aspect that most caught my attention was the fragility that both ecosystems present. I asked myself, will the Amazon forest have the same future as the Brandenburg forests?<br><br>The Amazon holds the largest tropical rainforest in the world, acting as a key component of the Earth's system. It plays a significant role in the carbon and water cycle, it displays the greatest biodiversity on Earth and it maintains climate stabilization in the basin. In addition to that, the forest harbors tremendous cultural and ethnic diversity of over 450 indigenous groups and more than 250 languages. The bad news is that Amazon is likely to have a biophysical tipping point. A combination of direct human pressures, fires and deforestation, paired with indirect pressures through climate change, could flip the system from a biodiverse moist, tropical rainforest to a less diverse dry, open forest or savanna.<br><br>Scientists agree that if the deforestation rates keep increasing, it will take about 20 to 30 years for 70 - 60 % of the forest to turn into Savanna. The only way to reverse that is to bring deforestation down to zero and start replanting the cleared areas.<br><br>This series of prints were produced In order to draw attention to the above mentioned issues. In this project the fragility of the Amazon and the Brandenburg forests is intended to become visible through the use of a sun printing technique in which the sun “burns” the image onto the paper. Unlike cyanotype, this method uses red dye, so the colour represents the lack of forest cover with more urgency.<br><br>The areas were selected based on the greater loss of forest cover and identified using the Global Forest Watch tool. In Brandenburg, the areas were chosen regarding their high pine density. To demonstrate the changes through time, the satellite images were taken from Google Timelapse in the following years 1984, 1993, 2002, 2011, and 2020. The camera distance is around 30 km and area approximately 41160 ha. <br><br>When analysing the satellite images of both forests over the years, it was noticed that the images of Brandenburg have hardly changed, in contrast to the Brazilian images, where the increase in deforestation is clearly visible. However, this does not mean that Brandenburg's forests are healthy and diverse. We can also see that deforestation in the Amazon is more recent compared to Germany.<br><br>A shift to a sustainable, post-capitalistic future is crucial to avoid the global environmental disaster that is just before us. It is not only an existential threat to our species but also a moral compromise we have with the nature and other life forms that inhabit this world.<br><br><br><br>Location of Pointcloud: <br>52°00\'18.6\"N 13°58\'48.1\"E - Biebersdorf<br><br>",

This term was first used by Alfred W. Cosby in his book The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences (1972). The Columbian Exchange is the process of biological unification between different continents that occurred since the first arrival of Columbus (1492). Then, humans started playing the role that geology and climate used to perform. We could say that, gradually, the biosphere started returning to the Pangea, reversing the separation caused by the continental drift. This exchange didn’t just occur in the trading context, but unintentionally, as in the case of several diseases (flu, measles...) that travelled unilaterally from Europe and Asia to the so called “New World”. Albert W. Cosby divided the procces of the Coumbian Exchange in three sections: plants, animals and diseases, but it wasn’t just about that. The different continents exchanged knowledge, culture and habits. Maybe it’s wrong to call it exchange, considering that the way it happened was deeply unequal, having disastrous consequences for the indigenous communities that still linger nowadays.

However, due to its rapid growth and simple cultivation methods, it was considered a pagan food. For this reason, the potato was initially used only to decorate elegant gardens. But Friedrich II the Great had to introduce it to the regular diet to combat the famines raging in his empire, of which Potsdam was the capital. His marketing campaign was curious, but very effective. He began to include the potato in royal court dishes and issued the Potato Edicts, in which he urged high society to show that the potato was a pleasant food. If it was suitable for the upper class, it had to be the same for the rural population. It also had the support of religion, with priests called \"tuber preachers\" who were charged with spreading all knowledge about the cultivation and culinary use of the potato.<br><br>Finally, he decided to plant the potato in his own garden and guard it strictly. Nevertheless, he talked to the guards so that people could steal the potato without consequences. »If it's well protected, it must be worth it« is a logical argument, and people thought the same way. With this reverse psychology, he achieved that the potato became a staple food for the people's diet and that more land was available for its cultivation to effectively fight the famines. Nowadays, the potato is still very important as it is a part of the typical German dishes. This part of his reign earned him the nickname \"Potato King\" and his tomb always bears potatoes in his honor.<br><br><img src='sr/sara_2.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto'><span class='italic'>Solanum Tuberosum</span><br><br>"

        content:"<img src='sr/sara_5.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto'><br>The turkey was domesticated by the Aztecs in Mexico, where it had a close relationship with humans. In addition, the turkey had great importance in the symbolic and religious aspects of the Nahuas. In the cosmogonies of ancient Mexico, they are described as people transformed by a flood of fire. Perhaps the connection between fire and turkey is that, according to the Legend of the Five Suns*, the turkey was the only bird available in times of drought. But the turkey's cultural value was not only spiritual: it was also an important part of the diet of several indigenous communities.<br><br>The colonists referred to the turkey as the \"ground hen\" because of its similarity to Spanish chickens. Nevertheless, turkeys had great gastronomic success due to their delicious flavor and high fat content. It was one of the first species introduced by Columbus to the Catholic kings, and soon became a popular dish among the Spanish nobility. An example of this is the way it was served to Carlos I at the banquet celebrating his coronation in 1530. Thus, turkey gradually became a common dish for special occasions, not only in the United States but also in Germany, where Thanksgiving is celebrated as a religious and rural tradition.<br><br>As in the rest of Europe, there are no wild turkey populations in Germany. There are only domesticated animals for gastronomic purposes. Even domestic populations in Germany have not had much success in the past. For example, the populations in Austria collapsed when they were not maintained due to the Second World War. In the XX century there were eleven attempts to establish turkeys in Germany, all of which failed.<br><br>*The Aztec myth describes how the Earth and all living things were created and the role played by the gods.

        content:"<img src='sr/sara_7.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto'><br><br>For obvious reasons, the farmable and rancher species were introduced in Europe since the second journey of Columbus (1493). Those species (rice went to America, or turkey to Europe) were exchanged in both directions for the benefit of the colonizers. However, most of American plants arrive as ornaments (even the edible ones), so, until the XVIII century, the cultivation of the American species doesn’t become widespread. In the same century, exploratory voyages increased, with the “climatization” of exotic species being the main direction of research. Exchanges between domesticated species took place in both directions, but not the transport of species kept for ornamental purposes. These profoundly unequal trade conditions persist to this day, as Amazon countries do not benefit from the illegal trade of their species (mainly birds) entering richer countries.<br><br>During the XX century, the mechanisms of introduction of \"exotic\" species have changed dramatically. On the one hand, the speed of transport technology and the ability to transport living organisms increased. Transport routes became shorter, allowing the transport of less resistant or long-lived species. Another crucial factor was the better lifestyle in wealthy countries. With this, long-distance tourism became more common, as did exotic pets and facilities such as zoos and aquariums.<br><br>"

The threat posed by these species is also genetic, as they sometimes interbreed with native species, creating new species that further alter the habitat. The effects of a biological invasion can even affect human health by causing new allergies or even being toxic (such as the giant parsley). The main reason for their arrival is the trade in \"exotic\" species, a crime that generates about $20 billion each year (and is even legal in some countries).

It is indeed a threat to biodiversity as it successfully hunts and thus exerts strong pressure on many species of fish, amphibians and small mammals. It has displaced the European mink to a large extent. The mink can spread very well, but the cause of its presence in Europe is the fur industry. Because of its shiny and beautiful fur, the mink is most often used for the production of clothing (such as coats). They spread in the 20th century, when the first fur companies were established and many mink disappeared from farms for lack of safety precautions.<br><br>People usually talk about how harmful these animals are to the environment and biodiversity, but not about the industry that brought them to Europe in the first place, which is particularly cruel. To make their hair more striking, the species has even been genetically modified to create blue or silver specimens. Fortunately, mink farms in Germany are disappearing (many were closed between 2017 and 2018), bringing the country closer to the government's goal of animal welfare.<br><br><img src='sr/sara_14.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto'><span class='italic'>Neovison vison</span><br><br>"

These crustaceans are not demanding: like other invasive species, they eat almost anything they can find. Worms, fish, snails or non-adult amphibians, the most endangered family of species. The red crab has a high and rapid reproduction rate and is also a carrier of a fungal disease (Aphanomyces astaci) that does not affect it but causes great harm to native crabs. In this way, in the waters where this crab has been introduced, the native species will inevitably become extinct. The red crab also damages the soil and plants (especially rice), as it is a great digger.<br><br>This crustacean is important in gastronomy, so it is bred in different parts of the world and escapes from aquariums. Because of its shiny color, it is also popular as a pet, and probably some specimens were abandoned by their owners when they got tired of them. In Europe it was first sighted in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, but now it is quite common in Germany, and it also reaches the north of Europe. The summer of 2017 was quite wet in Berlin, so some parts were flooded, which led to several unexpected effects. One of them was that numerous red crayfish wandered in the streets in the Tiergarten area: they were looking for a new habitat. Although the Berlin authorities successfully pushed them back, unfortunately there are already specimens in the Havel River (Brandenburg).<br><br><img src='sr/sara_16.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto'><span class='italic'>Procambarus clarkii</span><br><br>"

        content:"Ayahuasca is a pan-Amazonian psychoactive brew made out of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine (yagé), the Psychotria viridis shrub (chacruna), and possibly other ingredients. It is used both socially and as ceremonial spiritual medicine among some indigenous peoples of the Amazon. When consumed, it can cause an altered state of consciousness, including visual hallucinations and altered perceptions of reality. Ayahuasca ceremonies are getting increasingly popular around Europe and the United States and since some years tourism to South America for the purpose of taking it has grown a lot. Ayahuasca retreats are now getting founded around the world, enabling everyone to take part in the experience, may it be in a traditional or nontraditional way.<br><br>In this project we wanted to look further into the interconnectedness between Europe and South America, focussing on the boundary object, practice or concept of ayahuasca, contemplating how the cultural, social, geographical and economic landscapes around it have changed throughout the years.<br><br>Ayahuasca is known by many names such as caapi, cipo, hoasca, vegetal, uni, natem or shori. In the quechua languages,„aya“ can be translated as spirit, soul, corpse or dead body and „waska“ means rope, woody vine or liana. The word „ayahuasca“ has been variously translated as „liana of the soul“, „liana of the dead“ or „spirit liana“. Going back in history, ayahuasca was probably discovered by western society in the 19th century during the time of expeditions to the southamerican continent. Indigenous peoples in the Amazon already used the plant a long time before. The international interest in the brew, its medical qualities and the spiritual concepts around it has grown in recent years, making cities like Iquitos in Peru, nowadays a stronghold of ayahuasca tourism, popular destinations for many tourists.<br><br>The landscape of Iquitos has changed a lot during the last few years due to ayahuasca related tourism. The area was long inhabited by indigenous peoples and the city was probably founded around 1757 by Spanish Jesuits. It grew a lot during the Amazon rubber boom, where indigenous workers were kept in near slavery conditions. Then rubber seedlings were smuggled to Southeast Asia, undercutting prices of the Peruvian product. Now Tourism is one of the most important economic sectors in Iquitos as the city receives a considerable number of foreigners every year. Ayahuasca is known as a major cultural landmark, and spiritual tourism has increased tremendously. This boom can be noticed in the change of landscape throughout the last few decades. The city has expanded further into the amazon, hotels and ayahuasca retreats were built in the city but also the forests around it, by locals as well as by foreigners trying to make money out of commercializing the ayahuasca experience.<br><br><img src='hv/Iquitos1986.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><img src='hv/Iquitos2020.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><img src='hv/treecoverloss2001.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><img src='hv/treecoverloss2020.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><span class='italic'>© Google</span><br><br>In Germany, Ayahuasca is illegal. Still, there are several retreats offering ayahuasca ceremonies. Instead of the Psychotria viridis leafs, which are prohibited because of their high DMT component, they use Peganum Harmala seeds, creating a grey zone that makes it possible to consume a similar brew. Some of the retreats fly in indigenous people from the amazon to guide the ceremonies, but most of the time they are guided by europeans claiming to be shamans due to years of experience with the brew. The retreats are often located in already existent houses away from the city.

The complexity and interconnectedness of life is difficult to grasp from a siloed, dualistic and mono-humanist world view. In order to solve nowadays crises, an understanding of the world as a pluriverse is necessary. <br><br>How to design an interface that enforces different perspectives and communicates the social, economical and ecological system of mahogany in a pluriversal way?<br><br>By exploring interconnected stories about actors, species, forms and processes of mahogany in a web interface, the user slowly develops an understanding of the pluriverse. An illustrated mahogany tree symbolizes the original form of the resource and serves as the main interaction element and surface to host the content.<br><br><img src='vj/13.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><img src='vj/16.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'>"

        content:"The interface is conceptually divided in three phases that the user enters through scrolling: The colonial view, the indegenious view and the pluriversal view. Stories that can be assigned predominantly to a colonial view are located in the trees crown, while predominantly indigenous views are located in the roots, to emphasize the interconnectedness and dependancy of the colonial development on its indegenious origin. The pluriversal view is the final phase to reach. It displays connections between the nodes of the stories through links. To emphasize the transition to the pluriverse, the single mahogany tree from the first phase is embedded in a whole forest, that contains diverse species. This phase also offers an option for the user to add a story to the pluriverse of mahogany, so that it can grow bigger. As being part of the relational landscape project website, the pluriversal phase directly connects to its front page, showing the connection of mahogany to other species and matters from the amazon and Brandenburg.<br><br><br><br><span class='subHeadline'>Boundary Object</span><br><br>The framework of our interface was clear very quickly: we designed a mahogany tree as the interaction surface. On the one hand, this choice was thematically very obvious, on the other hand, the branches and roots of this tree are in a certain way a visually appealing form of a network.<br><br><img src='vj/Interaction Surface.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><br><br><br><br><span class='subHeadline'>Visual Design</span><br><br>The interface aims at sparking thoughts and connections while interacting with it and therefore uses a reduced visual language and a mono-spaced font. Its dominated by the mahogany tree as the main interaction element. A text panel on the right side displays the chosen topic. Main colors are a reddish-brown, used for the mahogany tree and interaction elements, black as background colour and white for the text panel. The reddish-brown colour draws connections to the color of mahogany wood, the black background symbolizes infinity and the notion of the pluriverse.<br><br><br><br><span class='subHeadline'>Stories</span><br><br>We decided to work out all the interesting, bizarre and, in our opinion, necessary topics as short, compact stories.<br><br>These stories are placed in a certain way in the sociogram and connect Brandenburg and South America. On the one hand, we highlight the sometimes absurd use of mahogany in Brandenburg in a critical and humorous way, and on the other hand, we try to tell „hidden“ stories of people living in South America.<br><br><img src='vj/Template 13.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><br><br><br><br><span class='subHeadline'>Sociogram and Information Hierarchy</span><br><br>Our goal was to transform the sociogram into the tree. We arranged the stories concerning Brandenburg in the crown of the tree and the indigenous stories in the root. This is to illustrate that from our western perspective only a fraction of the stories are visible, while a large part is „hidden“ under the surface. In addition, South America is the origin of mahogany, which again matches the root analogy.<br><br>At the beginning, the sociogram is still hidden and all the stories seem to float through the mahogany space as randomised points. Only in a subsequent interaction level does the tree grow a new branch that visualises the interconnection of all stories.<br><br><img src='vj/Transformed Sociogram.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><br><br><br><br><span class='subHeadline'>Participation - Growing the Pluriverse</span><br><br>Our interface offers the possibility to add own stories. In this way, we can integrate new perspectives detached from ourselves. For each story, the tree should grow a new branch.<br><br><img src='vj/Growing the Pluriverse.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><img src='vj/Prototype.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><br><br><br><br><span class='subHeadline'>Interdependence - Pluriverse View</span><br><br>In the course of our work, we became aware that the sociogram, even though it allows several perspectives, does not yet represent a Pluriverse view, but only an interconnection. If one realises the Pluriverse, much more has to be integrated. In a first attempt, we added more trees as examples to illustrate that more species are linked to the mahogany tree.<br><br><img src='vj/Pluriverse.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><br><br><br><br><span class='subHeadline'>Navigation - Diving into the Pluriverse</span><br><br>For a long time, navigation was a crucial point of our work:<br>How is it possible to view the different perspectives without unconsciously forcing a dualistic separation?<br><br>We tried to create different layers that could be accessed through buttons. In several iterations, we reworked the wording and gradually moved away from a too westernised style. But labels always support categorisation. We realised that this was completely contrary to the content of our interface. <br><br>In the end, we decided to take the user along on the journey to understanding the Pluriverse. The journey starts with the view the average user knows, stories from Brandenburg, and leads to indigenous stories. Everything is supported by a scrolling interaction. Then the sociogram slowly crystallises and makes clear that everything is connected. The interface then expands into a Pluriverse. <br><br>In summary, our interface is a journey from a westernised universal view to a Pluriverse.<br><br><img src='vj/Label Iterations.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'><img src='vj/13.webp' style='width:100%;height:auto;'>"

They use violence, move large fortunes and coerce the small guys.” Allegations of this nature led to a formal arraignment by a prosecutor in the state of Pará.",
                "According to its report, the “mahogany mafia” – who illegally extracted the timber to be sold in international markets – built clandestine roads, bridges, andairstrips, assembled a “war arsenal,” and exploited slave labor.",
                "Influential politicians, indigenous tribe leaders, and public officials from federal and local governments have also been accused of involvement in the illegal mahogany market."]
