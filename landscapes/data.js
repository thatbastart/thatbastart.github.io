        authors:"Hannah Machajdik & Victor Molina",
        content:"Ayahuasca is a pan-Amazonian psychoactive brew made out of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine (yagé), the Psychotria viridis shrub (chacruna), and possibly other ingredients. It is used both socially and as ceremonial spiritual medicine among some indigenous peoples of the Amazon. When consumed, it can cause an altered state of consciousness, including visual hallucinations and altered perceptions of reality. Ayahuasca ceremonies are getting increasingly popular around Europe and the United States and since some years tourism to South America for the purpose of taking it has grown a lot. Ayahuasca retreats are now getting founded around the world, enabling everyone to take part in the experience, may it be in a traditional or nontraditional way.<br><br>In this project we wanted to look further into the interconnectedness between Europe and South America, focussing on the boundary object, practice or concept of ayahuasca, contemplating how the cultural, social, geographical and economic landscapes around it have changed throughout the years.<br><br>The result is an augmented reality liana, that can grow anywhere in the world, by just scanning a QR-code with your phone. Once it's placed, you can walk around it and find a lot of information, articles about and experiences of ayahuasca in South America but also Europe, collected on little tokens that are placed in different parts of the plant. Additionally there is an interview with a shaman of the amazonian tribe Shuar in Ecuador who guides traditional ayahuasca experiences in his community, talking about his view on the concept of spirituality, spiritual tourism, the economic profit from it and his own path of learning about ayahuasca.<br><br>We invite you to scan the QR-code and explore the liana yourself!<br><br>",

        authors:"Sabrina Machado",
        content:"This project was initiated by investigating correlations between the forests in Brandenburg, Germany and the Amazon rainforest, Brazil.<br><br>According to the forest status report from 2021, 73% of all trees in Brandenburg are pine trees and from those plants, only 10% present no crown damage.The history of pine cultivation in Brandenburg is marked by the species' good adaptation to the region's sandy soil associated with the need for wood production. However, since monocultures are more susceptible to pests and forest fires, what seemed like a good solution ended up creating a new challenge for the region.<br><br>After a period of research, the aspect that most caught my attention was the fragility that both ecosystems present. I asked myself, will the Amazon forest have the same future as the Brandenburg forests?<br><br>The Amazon holds the largest tropical rainforest in the world, acting as a key component of the Earth's system. It plays a significant role in the carbon and water cycle, it displays the greatest biodiversity on Earth and it maintains climate stabilization in the basin. In addition to that, the forest harbors tremendous cultural and ethnic diversity of over 450 indigenous groups and more than 250 languages. The bad news is that Amazon is likely to have a biophysical tipping point. A combination of direct human pressures, fires and deforestation, paired with indirect pressures through climate change, could flip the system from a biodiverse moist, tropical rainforest to a less diverse dry, open forest or savanna.<br><br>Scientists agree that if the deforestation rates keep increasing, it will take about 20 to 30 years for 70 - 60 % of the forest to turn into Savanna. The only way to reverse that is to bring deforestation down to zero and start replanting the cleared areas.<br><br>This series of prints were produced In order to draw attention to the above mentioned issues. In this project the fragility of the Amazon and the Brandenburg forests is intended to become visible through the use of a sun printing technique in which the sun “burns” the image onto the paper. Unlike cyanotype, this method uses red dye, so the colour represents the lack of forest cover with more urgency.<br><br>The areas were selected based on the greater loss of forest cover and identified using the Global Forest Watch tool. In Brandenburg, the areas were chosen regarding their high pine density. To demonstrate the changes through time, the satellite images were taken from Google Timelapse in the following years 1984, 1993, 2002, 2011, and 2020. The camera distance is around 30 km and area approximately 41160 ha. <br><br>When analysing the satellite images of both forests over the years, it was noticed that the images of Brandenburg have hardly changed, in contrast to the Brazilian images, where the increase in deforestation is clearly visible. However, this does not mean that Brandenburg's forests are healthy and diverse. We can also see that deforestation in the Amazon is more recent compared to Germany.<br><br>A shift to a sustainable, post-capitalistic future is crucial to avoid the global environmental disaster that is just before us. It is not only an existential threat to our species but also a moral compromise we have with the nature and other life forms that inhabit this world",

This term was first used by Alfred W. Cosby in his book The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences (1972). The Columbian Exchange is the process lf biological unification between different continents that occured since the first arrival of Columbus (1492). Then, humans started playing the role that geology and climate used to perform. We could say that, gradually, the biosphere started returning to the Pangea, reversing the separation caused by the continental drift. This exchange didn’t just occur in the trading context, but unintentionally, as in the case of several diseases (flu, measles...) that travelled unilaterally from Europe and Asia to the so called “New World”. Albert W. Cosby divided the procces of the Coumbian Exchange in three sections: plants, animals and diseases, but it wasn’t just about that. The different continents exchanged knowledge, culture and habits. Maybe it’s wrong to call it exchange, considering that the way it happened was deeply unequal, having disastrous consequences for the indigenous communities that still linger nowadays.

But Friedrich II the Great had to introduce it in the normal diet to fight the famines ravaging his empire, whose capital was Potsdam. His marketing campaign was curious but very effective. He started including the potatoe in the royal court dishes, and releasing the edicts of the potatoe, in which he demanded the high society to show how the potatoe was a pleasant food. If it was suitable for the high class, it had to be the same for peasants. He also had the support of the religion, with priests named “tuber preachers”, in charge of spreading all knowledge related to the farming and culinary uses of potatoes. Lastly, he decided to plant it in his personal gardens, establishing strong security to guard it. But nevertheless, he spoke to the guardians to let the people steal the potato without consequences. “If it’s well protected, it must be worth it”, it’s a logical argument, and the people thought the same. With this reverse psychology he achieved the potatoe to be a key food in the feeding of the people, and to make more land dedicated to it’s cultive, fighting effectively the famines. Nowadays it still is very important, being part of the typical German dishes.

During the War of the Thirty Years, the soldiers brought tobacco to the High Rin, and the first tobacco factories were initially located around Basel. In 1900 there were around 300 tobacco factories in the High Rin. Another regions that also standed out for the tobacco cultivation were Baden-Würtemberg, Bavaria and Brandenburg. Like other European countries, Germany farmed tobacco because of the import restriction and the strong increase of the demand, all together with the law that obliged to add a percentage of the national product (German tobacco was always for local consumption). Nevertheless, the percentage of cultivated tobacco in the country was still pretty low, because the big factories mainly used tobacco that came from the United States, Cuba or Brasil. In Uckermark (Brandenburg), the French Huguenots introduced the tobacco 400 years ago.

It was one of the first species that Columbus presented to the Catholic Kings, and it soon became a popular dish between the Spanish nobility. An example of this is the way Carlos I had them served at the banquet celebrating his coronation in 1530.

The exchange between domesticated species occurred in both directions, but the transportations of species with ornamental intention dind’t. These profoundly unequal trade conditions continue to this day, as Amazon countries do not benefit from the ilegal trade of their species (mainly birds) entering richer countries. During the XX century, the mechanisms of introduction of “exotic” species changed drastically. On one hand, the transportation technology increased in speed and the capacity of bringing living organisms. Transport distances became shorter so that less resistant or long-lived species could also be shipped. The ballast water system is created in order to transport more aquatic species. Another determining factor was the better lifestyle in the wealthy countries.

The red crab also damages the soil and crops (specially rice) because it is a great digger.<br><br>This crustace has relevance in the gastronomic industry and that’s the reason why it has been raised in several parts of the world, escaping from the aquariums. Because of it’s shiny color, it’s also popular as a pet, and probably some specimens were released by their owners when they got tired of them. In Europe it has been first seen in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, but now it’s pretty common in Germany, and they are reaching the north of Europe. The summer of 2017 was pretty damp in Berlin, so some parts were flooded, causing several unexpected effects. One of them was how numerous red crabs wandered in the streets in the area of Tiergarten: they were looking for a new habitat. Although the Berlin authorities reduced them successfully, unfortunately specimens are already in the Havel river (Brandenburg).<br><br><img src='sr/sara_16.png' style='width:100%;height:auto'><span class='italic'>Procambarus clarkii</span><br><br>"
