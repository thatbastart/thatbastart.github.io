After two summer courses with drummer Dre Pallemaerts he went to the Conservatory of Brussels where he was taught by Hans Van Oosterhout. Since graduating from this school in 1999, he became a very demanded musical ‘mercenary’. His search for a personal touch and wanting to explore all possibilities of playing drums, his lack of boundaries and trying to find fresh sounds in collective improvisation made him work with countless bands and musicians. As initiator and motor of his own bands, he is  on a constant search of interesting band settings and musical output since 2005. With Bruno Vansina he founded the label Rat Records in 2003 and together with his partner Lien Van Steendam he runs the artist workplace Werkplaats Walter since 2016. </div>
